# Conformal Lattice Planner

This respository provides conformal lattice planner C++ implementations for autonomous driving tasks. The software is build upon [Carla](http://carla.org/) and [ROS](https://www.ros.org/).

## Workspace Setup

The setup of the workspace can be a bit tricky, mostly because Carla 0.9.6 uses Boost 1.69 but Ubuntu 18.04 has Boost 1.65 by default. Therefore, we have to complie almost all of the dependencies from source and link against the customized compiled libraries. All dependencies are listed as follows. The details of the setup can be found [here](scripts/workspace_setup.md).

### Dependencies
* [Boost 1.69.0](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_69_0/)
* [PCL 1.9.1](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/releases/tag/pcl-1.9.1)
* [ROS Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic)
* [catkin tools](https://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [Carla 0.9.6](https://carla.org/2019/07/12/release-0.9.6/)

## Software Framework and Usage

This repository currently focuses on motion planning algorithms for self-driving vehicles. Therefore, we have only developed the simulation and planning software stack for now. Many sensing capabilities provided by Carla has not been interfaced. For such sensing capabilities, check [Carla-ROS bridge](https://github.com/carla-simulator/ros-bridge) for a python interface. More software details can be found [here](scripts/software_framework_usage.md)
